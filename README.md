Welcome to Bulgaria - a land of roses, IT developers and bumpy roads!

**HOLE ESCAPE** is an arcade game, based on the classic CARS game, which
puts you behind the **gevreka** of Pesho's car. Pesho has just **kacnal**
from his **brigada** in the **Shtatite** and bought **Golf 3-ka**. He is now
working as a driver for **UBER SOFIA** and needs to build a positive
Customer Satisfaction Rating. Help him **manevrira** the car away from all
the terrible **crateri** on the road, so his passengers travel pleasantly.
